Nim Game: There are 3 piles of stones, with varying numbers of stones, and there are 3 players that will each take turns taking stones from the piles that have differing amounts of stones. If a player is the last one to take a stone from a pile, they can either gain 2 points or steal 1 from someone else. The player who picks up the last stone of all of them will get 1 point. The max amount of stones a person can take at a time is 2. A person, we will call them Player A, is given the opportunity to pick whether they will go first, second or third. You have to decide which spot Player A goes in to help them win. Note: all players will act rationally, with their best interests in mind. 


Example of what piles look like (example has pile 1: 16 stones, pile 2: 4 stones, pile 3: 9 stones)
